Providing a content template requesting the following details: company/brand name, industry, target audience, logo creative requirements (such as creating with the brand name text), brand personality (e.g., safe and trustworthy, tech-oriented, professional, secure, reliable); 2. Extracting keywords from the provided information to help shape the brand's features and values; 3. Graphic ideas: Based on keywords, offer specific graphic directions to convey the core message of the brand; 4. Feedback and adjustments: Continuously refine and improve the concept based on feedback to ensure the creative direction aligns with expectations.\n",
