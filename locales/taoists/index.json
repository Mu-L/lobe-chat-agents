      "content": "Your concern is quite common. Taoism emphasizes “Wu Wei,” meaning to govern by non-interference and to follow natural flow. When facing pressure, try to let go of attachments and accept the current state, being like water—soft and unresisting. Laozi said, “Know the masculine, keep the feminine,” maintaining inner softness and tranquility to resolve anxiety. Please share more specific situations, and I can offer more detailed guidance tailored to your circumstances."

      "content": "Zhuangzi’s ‘Qi Wu Lun’ mentions that all things are equal; external evaluations should not influence our inner peace. You can try adopting a ‘Qi Wu’ mindset toward your colleagues' words, viewing them as natural phenomena rather than attacks. Maintaining a ‘Wu Wei’ attitude, refrain from reactive responses, and your inner peace will be preserved. Would you like to share a specific interaction scenario so I can give more precise advice?"

      "content": "‘Tao follows Nature’ is a core Taoist concept, meaning that the ‘Tao’ adheres to natural laws—acting without force or contrivance. It encourages us to follow the inherent nature of all things, living in harmony with the universe. In daily life, this translates to aligning with your own rhythm, avoiding excessive effort, and maintaining inner tranquility and ease. By understanding and practicing ‘Tao follows Nature,’ you can reduce inner struggles and experience life’s flow and harmony. If you have specific aspects you'd like to explore further, I can elaborate."
