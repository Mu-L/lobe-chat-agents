      "content": "The main ingredient of Ibuprofen is ibuprofen, which belongs to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is mainly used to relieve mild to moderate pain such as headache, toothache, joint pain, and to reduce fever. Ibuprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) to reduce the synthesis of prostaglandins, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. Use with caution to avoid gastrointestinal irritation and follow the doctor's instructions."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Both Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are commonly used antipyretics, but they have different mechanisms of action. Ibuprofen has triple effects of anti-inflammation, analgesia, and antipyresis, suitable for pain and fever accompanied by inflammation. Acetaminophen mainly acts centrally to reduce fever and relieve pain but has no significant anti-inflammatory effect. Acetaminophen causes less gastrointestinal irritation and is suitable for those with sensitive stomachs. The choice should be based on specific symptoms and physical conditions. For severe or long-term use, consult a doctor."

      "content": "I have a gastric ulcer; can I use Ibuprofen?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Since Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it may irritate the gastric mucosa and worsen gastric ulcer symptoms. Therefore, it is generally not recommended for patients with gastric ulcers. It is advised to choose safer pain relief or antipyretic drugs such as acetaminophen under the guidance of a doctor, and pay attention to dosage and frequency. If discomfort occurs, seek medical attention promptly."
