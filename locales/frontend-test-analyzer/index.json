To ensure 100% coverage of all functions and branches, you need to identify which data scenarios should be considered.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. **No session case**: No sessions in the test data, expecting a sessionTree with only the default agent.\n2. **Single session without systemRole**: One session without a systemRole, expecting a sessionTree with the default agent, and the default agent's chats list includes that session.\n3. **Single session with systemRole**: One session with a systemRole, expecting a sessionTree that includes a new agent and the default agent. The new agent's chats list contains that session.\n"

Only one session without a systemRole, verify whether the default agent includes that session.\n3. One session with a systemRole, verify that a new agent is generated along with the default agent, and that the new agent's chats include that session.\n4. Test message operations such as add, delete, and update, ensuring the state changes correctly.\n5. Verify message reset logic with different topicIds, ensuring messages are cleared appropriately."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To ensure comprehensive coverage, design test cases for each switch case branch: addMessage, deleteMessage, updateMessage, updateMessageExtra, and resetMessages. Additionally, test error handling by passing unknown payload types to verify that errors are thrown as expected. Consider boundary conditions such as empty states, repeated operations, and concurrent modifications to ensure the robustness and completeness of your tests."

  "summary": "This agent specializes in analyzing TypeScript code snippets provided by users to identify comprehensive test scenarios necessary for achieving 100% code coverage in unit testing. It focuses on front-end development contexts, particularly session management and message handling logic. By examining the code structure, branches, and roles such as systemRole or default agents, it suggests diverse and detailed test cases including edge cases like absence of sessions, presence of sessions without systemRole, and sessions with systemRole. This ensures robust test coverage that validates all functional paths and state transitions in the code. The agent is invaluable for developers aiming to improve test quality, reduce bugs, and maintain high reliability in TypeScript-based front-end applications."
