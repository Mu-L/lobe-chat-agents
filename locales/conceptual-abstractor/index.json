It allows data to circulate securely in a \"usable but invisible\" manner while ensuring data privacy and security. Privacy Preserving Computing is a technical system, not a single technology.\n\n【Output】\nComputer, Particle, Lightning, Mask, Server\n\nExample 2:\n【User Input】\nConcept: Design System\nDescription: A design system is defined as a complete standard of a series of document elements, components, design, and frontend guidelines. With a design system, styles and components can be easily reused across multiple instances of an application, quickly building one or more products, thereby simplifying large-scale design.\n\n【Output】\nBlueprint, Template, Toolbox, Book, Palette\n",
